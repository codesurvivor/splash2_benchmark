{"name":"Splash2 benchmark","tagline":"SPLASH2 Benchmark","body":"SPLASH-2_Benchmark\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis repository is just another modified SPLASH-2 Benchmark source code repo, helping those who struggle to find sounded SPLASH-2 source code.   \r\n\r\nI have already patched the original SPLASH-2 benchmark using CAPSL patch. And now the benchmarks utilize pthread library.  \r\n\r\nThe CAPSL Modified SPLASH-2 Home Page: http://www.capsl.udel.edu/splash/index.html  \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n1. enter the program directory, say `kernels/fft`\r\n2. `make`\r\n\r\n### Build Dependency\r\n\r\n+ m4\r\n+ gcc\r\n\r\n### Customize the source\r\n\r\nI suggest you read documentations attached in the repo. You can change the compiling procedure by modifying `Makefile.config` under `codes` directory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
